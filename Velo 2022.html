When I first met you
</h1>
<p style="color:blue;" >
Lets take a trip down memory lane, as we relieve the highlights of Velo 2022
</p>
<h2 style="color:yellow;" >
Meeting
</h2>
<p style="color:white;" >
I love how unconventional our first meeting was.</br>
I was in my feelings, and felt directionless and </br>
posted a quote on a group chat that everyone ignored</b>
besides you. That was the start to an insane journey.</b>

This is another reminder that you find physicall health</b>
just as important as mental health. Great physique by the way :)"</b>

I lost my breath at the shear beauty that radiated from you.</br>

Uncertainty
</h2>
<p style="color:orange;">
This is the period where I distanced myself from you</b>
because I was questioning whether I bore you or not.</b>
It was a confusing time for me, for we stopped talking</b>
as much as we did in the beginning of the year. We went</b>
from talking everyday whenever you were online to me leaving</b>
you countless messages without any reply. That really hurt and</b>
I thought it was best to distance myself from you to protect myself.</b>
When you eventually reached out to me, I then understood that you</b>
genuinly cared and that you don't hurt others intentionally.</b>

This here proves that men CAN focus on two things at once <p>&#x1F608;</p><p>&#x1F601;</p><p>&#x1F602;</p>

Dress; crop top; whatever you wear, you manage to bring</br> 
inanimate objects to life and bask in your glory. <p>&#x1F929;</p></br>
</p>
<p style="color:brown;">
Speaking of, I remember I once asked for a crop top + jeans look, but </br>
you said you didnt have. I didnt get a chance to ask how come cause you </br>
were mizing <p>&#x1F915;</p>. 
</p>
<p style="color:brown;">
Why is it? Is it not your style? Not a fan of it?</br>
Because let me tell you, whenever I go out to Mall of Africa, or Woodmead, </br>
these huns show off their cleavage to the point where I have to maintain order </br>
with the boys and keep them from losing all sense of composure <p>&#x1F923;</p><p>&#x1F480;</p> </br>
</p>
<p style="color:brown;">
I do apologise for slightly getting off track, lets continue, shall we? <p>&#x1F602;</p>

I remember when you made this your DP</br>
on WhatsApp. This was the first time I</br>
actually saw you. Had this image dancing</br>
around in my head for weeks. <p>&#xF629;</p>

Conclusion
</h2>
<p style="color:Red;">
I hope you enjoyed my presentation down 
memory lane. I wanted to make this as best as I could.</br>
I can't say I know what happens next, but </br>
I look forward to the challenges the new year </br>
brings. I have told you I loved you before, and will </br>
continue to prove so until you yourself can believe it.</br>
As I re-read this to myself, I realise that this gesture </br>
may be overwhelming,but I want you to know I always got your back.</br>
Fun fact, this website is the very first I made for a person outside</br>
of tasks or work. Hope you like it. <p>&#x1F605;</p></br>
</p>
<p style="color:green;">
Anyways, have a wonderful Christmas Inkosazana elikhanyayo and </br>
a Happy New Year. <p>&#x1F973;</p>
